# Sales Analytics Dashboard (Tableau Project)

This project presents a complete Tableau dashboard built using the **Global Superstore dataset**.  
The goal is to design a clear and interactive dashboard that helps stakeholders analyze **Sales, Profit, and Quantity** across different periods and categories.

## 1. Project Purpose

The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a clean and intuitive view of:
- Overall yearly performance  
- Monthly trends  
- Subcategory comparisons  
- Customer & regional patterns  
- Key KPIs such as Sales, Profit, Quantity, and YoY% changes

This dashboard follows a real-world BI workflow similar to what data analysts build in companies.

## 2. Business Requirements

The business requires a sales dashboard that provides an overview of total yearly Sales, Profit, and Quantity, including a comparison between the current year and previous year and showing the year-over-year percentage change. The dashboard should also display monthly trends for each KPI, highlight the highest and lowest months, and include a subcategory comparison for sales and profit. Weekly trends for the current year may be included, showing the weekly values along with an average line and indicating which weeks are above or below the average. The dashboard should also support user interaction through filters.

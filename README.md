# Sales Analytics Dashboard (Tableau Project)

This project presents a complete Tableau dashboard built using the **Global Superstore dataset**.  
The goal is to design a clear and interactive dashboard that helps stakeholders analyze **Sales, Profit, and Quantity** across different periods and categories.

## 1. Project Purpose

The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a clean and intuitive view of:
- Overall yearly performance  
- Monthly trends  
- Subcategory comparisons  
- Customer & regional patterns  
- Key KPIs such as Sales, Profit, Quantity, and YoY% changes

This dashboard follows a real-world BI workflow similar to what data analysts build in companies.

- Subcategory area  
- Filters panel  

---

## 7. Tools Used

## 9. Key Insights (Example)

Once built, the dashboard can answer:
